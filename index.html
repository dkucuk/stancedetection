<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p/>
Stance detection (also known as stance classification, stance prediction, and stance analysis) is a problem related to social media analysis, natural language processing, and information retrieval, which aims to determine the position of a person from a piece of text they produce, towards a target (a concept, idea, event, etc.) either explicitly specified in the text, or implied only. Common stance classes include Favor, Against, and None. In this tutorial, we will define the core concepts and other related research problems, present historical and contemporary approaches to stance detection (including shared tasks and tools employed), provide pointers to related datasets, and cover open research directions and application areas of stance detection. As solutions to stance detection can contribute to diverse applications including trend analysis, opinion surveys, user reviews, personalization, and predictions for referendums and elections, it will continue to stand as an important research problem, mostly on textual content currently, and particularly on Web content including social media.

Fazli Can received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and electronics and computer engineering and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1976, 1979, and 1985, respectively. He conducted his Ph.D. research under the supervision of Prof. E. Ozkarahan; at Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA, and Intel, Chandler, AZ, USA; as a part of the RAP Database Machine Project. He is currently a Faculty Member at Bilkent University, Ankara. Before joining Bilkent, he was a tenured Full Professor at Miami University, Oxford, OH, USA. He co-edited ACM SIGIR Forum from 1995 to 2002 and is a Co-Founder of the Bilkent Information Retrieval Group, Bilkent University. His interest in dynamic information processing dates back to his 1993 incremental clustering paper in ACM Transactions on Information Systems and some other earlier work with Prof. E. Ozkarahan on dynamic cluster maintenance. His current research interests include information retrieval and data mining.
